Web frameworks:
    Based on net/http:
        net/http (ok performance)
        gorilla/mux (ok performance; compatible with http.Handler; idiomatic Go; used in Yandex)
        gin (ok performance; compatible with net/http; de facto standard; but too much magic and un-idiomatic)
        chi (ok performance; compatible with http.Handler; idiomatic Go)
        echo (ok performance; more straightforward; not compatible with http.Handler)
        Sentry supports: net/http, Gin, Echo, FastHTTP

    Based on fasthttp:
        fasthttp (too fast; might not be for you!!)
        fiber (fast. like Express. Not compatible with net/http: based on fasthttp)
        gearbox (too fast; based on fasthttp; not popular)
        atreugo (too fast; based on fasthttp; not popular)

    Other:
        go kit (for microservices)

    Not good:
        beego (all inclusive, rapid development; like Django / Ruby on Rails)

    GraphQL:
        gqlgen 
        ent 

logger: glog, zap / zerolog
