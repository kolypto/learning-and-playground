# Widgets

## Basic Widgets

* `Text`: styled text
* `Center`: centers an element in the middle of the screen
* `Row`, `Column`: flexbox: horizontal and vertical layout directions.
* `Stack`: lets you place widgets on top of one another. Use `Positioned` to move them
* `Container`: rectangular visual element, with margins and padding, with constraints, with `BoxDecoration` to color, border, shadow.
  Matrix 3D transformations are possible too.
